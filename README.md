# 👋 Hello, I’m Aya Mekni

Sometimes all it takes is a dataset and an idea — and I’m already spinning up models, crafting APIs, and designing dashboards. I’m a Computer Science engineering student in Tunisia, specializing in **Data Science & Artificial Intelligence**, and I love the moment when messy data transforms into something insightful, beautiful, or just plain useful.

## 🧩 I Like to Build Things That...

- Understand the world (even just a little better) through **machine learning**
- Automate what’s boring with **Python, scraping, and APIs**
- Tell stories with data using **Power BI, Tableau, and clean code**
- Combine **frontend magic** with **backend muscle** to make ideas come alive

## 🛠 Some of My Favorite Experiments

🧠 **Trash to Cash**  
→ A CNN-powered app that scans recycling logos in real-time. Think TensorFlow, Keras, and React all talking to each other behind the scenes. Bonus: JWT auth and MongoDB-backed predictions.

📊 **Sales Trend Analysis**  
→ Built in Power BI. Explores how customers behave, what products dominate, and how managers influence sales. Pie charts never looked so smart.

🫁 **Lung Cancer Classifier**  
→ Medical imaging meets machine learning. Used ResNet and VGGNet models to spot early signs — one scan at a time.

💼 **JobNest**  
→ Scraped job listings from LinkedIn using Selenium + Beautiful Soup, stored it in MongoDB, and made the data searchable via Flask.

🏠 **University Housing System**  
→ A clean Spring Boot web app that does it all: dorm reservations, custom queries, REST APIs, and a backend that just won’t quit.
